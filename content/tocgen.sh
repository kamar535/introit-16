# Small script for generating markdown toc.
# Change variables to suit your needs.
# Assumes TOC is marked by a header, followed by another header.
# Note that all text between these is deleted, recovery is possible via backed up files.


# Modify this variable for the files your looking for
files=`ls *.md`

# This searches for keyword. Note that regex is handled by both sed and awk
keyword="#*# InnehÃ¥ll"


for i in $files; do
    # Backup files in case of screw-up
    cp $i ${i}.tocbk

    # 1. Grep all lines starting with `##` (assume headers)
    # 2. Remove line containing keyword
    # 3. Substitute all h2 with `+`
    # 4. Substitute the rest of `#` with `\t`
    # 5. Place header-title in square brackets, and lower-case copy following `(#`
    # 6. This line is *icky*, point is we want to keep alnum and *some* special chars (eg / and -)
    #    We do this by matching a string of desired characters until it hits an undesired one and removing it
    #    (I suspect learning awk would solve this, but meh)
    # 7. Replace all whitespaces and remaining special chars with `-`
    # 8. Reduce >1 occurences with `-` to single `-`
    # 9. Add closing `)` to end of all lines
